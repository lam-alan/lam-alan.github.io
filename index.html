            <p>I'm Alan Lam and I'm a self-taught website maker.</p>
            <p>With only 5 months (at the time of this writing) of experience and informal instruction, I wouldn't call myself a web developer. To me, web developer makes it sound like I'm an expert.</p>
            <p>So although I'm no expert, I do have a basic understanding of the language and components of a website. I did make this website after all. It may not be fancy and flashy - nor may it follow traditional web development standards - but it works.</p>
            <p>I learned how to make websites by taking classes on <a class="link" href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>, an online platform that offers free coding classes. Once I understood the basics, I applied the concepts and <a class="link" href="https://alan-lam.github.io/v1" target="_blank">made a website</a>*. Yeah, I just jumped right in. It wasn't a flawless transition - as hardly anything ever is - but there is a learning curve, and, for me, jumping right in was getting over the curve.</p>
            <p>It was the first real website I created on my own. It was when I was able to confidently say, "I know how to make a website".</p>
            <p>This website is the second website I've created. This website is the result of roughly 5 months of learning and building. Whether that's impressive or not, I would say that the time it takes to learn isn't that long. Granted, having programming experience helps immensely, but you don't need to know how to code in order to learn.</p>
            <p>With that said, welcome to this website. Made by a beginner. For a beginner.</p>
            <p>*That was my old one. My current website is <a class="link" href="https://alanlam.netlify.com" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

            <h3>Is Codecademy Good For Learning How to Code?</h3>
            <h6>Isn't the answer always "yes" to academic works with questions as titles?</h6>
            <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/codecademy_critique.jpg">
            <p>Codecademy. "The Leaders in Online Coding" they proclaim. Chances are, you've probably heard of it. If not, ask someone who knows how to code. Not only will they likely have heard of it, but they also might even recommend it too. With 25 million users, Codecademy certainly is popular. But is it effective?</p>
            <div class="collapse" id="collapseCritique">
              <p>Let's start with it's biggest selling point. It is free. Despite how badly that may sound, you actually do learn quite a lot of new things. That is, if you've never coded before. There's not really anything to lose - in terms of money anyways. So that's good.</p>
              <p>But the saying, "you get what you pay for" really comes into play here. The quality of education you get from Codecademy courses just doesn't compare to the quality of education from university courses. It is totally possible to learn solely from Codecademy and get a job. But people who take university courses are likely going to be better programmers.</p>
              <p>This is because Codecademy courses are essentially handing you a bag of facts. More specifically, a bag of syntax. It is true that in order to know how to code, you have to know the language you're using. This is where Codecademy is effective. But knowing the language is only a <i>small</i> part of coding. The big part is knowing how to problem solve. This is where Codecademy fails.</p>
              <p>That stems from the way the courses are taught. They put a lot of emphasis on teaching how code is written. Now that is important because the target audience is people who've never coded before. But the exercises boil down to, "Here's how to do this. Now do it here."</p>
              <img class="img-fluid" src="./pictures/codecademy_instructions.jpg">
              <p>I mean, they tell you <i>exactly</i> where to put the id.</p>
              <p>To be fair, that is the first time they are introducing the concept of an id attribute. So it's fine as long as you get a chance to apply it later. However, the courses don't revisit information you've previously learned. The obvious problem with that is you forget what you've learned. The subtle, and more important, problem with that is it doesn't give you the chance to <i>actually</i> apply what you've learned. In the exercises, the only reason you do something is because you <i>just</i> learned it. There's not a moment when you figure out, "Oh, in order to get what I want, I have to use what I previously learned." Emphasis on figure out.</p>
              <p>Now, with the Pro version, you do get the opportunities to apply what you've learned and problem solve your way through a project. But you have to pay. And most people are using Codecademy because it's free.</p>
              <p>Codecademy is a good starting point for learning web development -  or any programming - but there are flaws. By taking the courses, you walk away knowing the syntax of the language, but not with the mentality of a programmer. If you just want to get your hands wet with coding, then Codecademy is great for that. If you want to dive in deep, then do more than just Codecademy.</p>

          <p>What is this? A disclaimer! I might get some of the terminology wrong. That's because, as a beginner, I generalize things to make it easier for me to understand. Also, I don't think about the terminology when I'm coding. The goal of this website isn't to be able to name the pieces. The goal is to know how to use the pieces.</p>

          <p>Good websites are made up of a lot of complicated pieces (of code). However, all websites contain basic elements and build upon them to create the more complicated pieces. This tutorial will introduce what those basic elements are so you are familiar with the fundamentals of making websites.</p>
