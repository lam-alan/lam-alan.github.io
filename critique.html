            <p>Codecademy. "The Leaders in Online Coding" they proclaim. Chances are, you've probably heard of it. If not, ask someone who knows how to code. Not only will they likely have heard of it, but they also might even recommend it too. With 25 million users, Codecademy certainly is popular. But is it effective?</p>
            <p>Let's start with it's biggest selling point. It is free. Despite how badly that may sound, you actually do learn quite a lot of new things. That is, if you've never coded before. There's not really anything to lose - in terms of money anyways. So that's good.</p>
            <p>But the saying, "you get what you pay for" really comes into play here. The quality of education you get from Codecademy courses just doesn't compare to the quality of education from university courses. It is totally possible to learn solely from Codecademy and get a job. But people who take university courses are likely going to be better programmers.</p>
            <p>This is because Codecademy courses are essentially handing you a bag of facts. More specifically, a bag of syntax. It is true that in order to know how to code, you have to know the language you're using. This is where Codecademy is effective. But knowing the language is only a <i>small</i> part of coding. The big part is knowing how to problem solve. This is where Codecademy fails.</p>
            <p>That stems from the way the courses are taught. They put a lot of emphasis on teaching how code is written. Now that is important because the target audience is people who've never coded before. But the exercises boil down to, "Here's how to do this. Now do it here."</p>
            <div class="img-center">

            <p>I mean, they tell you <i>exactly</i> where to put the id.</p>
            <p>To be fair, that is the first time they are introducing the concept of an id attribute. So it's fine as long as you get a chance to apply it later. However, the courses don't revisit information you've previously learned. The obvious problem with that is you forget what you've learned. The subtle, and more important, problem with that is it doesn't give you the chance to <i>actually</i> apply what you've learned. In the exercises, the only reason you do something is because you <i>just</i> learned it. There's not a moment when you figure out, "Oh, in order to get what I want, I have to use what I previously learned." Emphasis on figure out.</p>
            <p>Now, with the Pro version, you do get the opportunities to apply what you've learned and problem solve your way through a project. But you have to pay. And most people are using Codecademy because it's free.</p>
            <p>Codecademy is a good starting point for learning web development -  or any programming - but there are flaws. By taking the courses, you walk away knowing the syntax of the language, but not with the mentality of a programmer. If you just want to get your hands wet with coding, then Codecademy is great for that. If you want to dive in deep, then do more than just Codecademy.</p>
