          <p>I'm Alan Lam. At the time of this writing, I am a third-year Math-Computer Science student at UCSD. As likely as it may seem, I did not really learn how to make websites by taking computer science courses. There was one lab in the Software Engineering course that went over making websites, but I didn't really learn much from that.</p>
          <p>It's May 2018 right now. I actually learned how to make a website in January 2018. I wouldn't exactly call myself an expert when I've only been doing this for about 5 months. But I do have a basic understanding of the language and components of a website. I did build this website from scratch after all. It may not be fancy and flashy, but it works.</p>
          <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are the two main components for building a website. I learned how to work with both of them by taking classes on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>, an online platform that offers free coding classes. Once I understood the basics, I applied the concepts and <a href="https://alan-lam.github.io" target="_blank">made a website</a>. (A lot of similarities to this one.) Yeah, I just jumped right in. It wasn't a flawless transition - as hardly anything ever is - but there is a learning curve to web development, and, for me, jumping right in was getting over the curve.</p>

          <p>The third main component for building a website is JavaScript, which is a programming language. This is usually what makes websites fancy and flashy. This is also another reason why I would not consider myself an expert. I haven't learned how to work with it yet.</p>

          <p>I'm still updating and maintaining the first website I created. That sounds a little sentimental, which was unintentional, but it kind of is in a way. It was the first real thing I created on my own. It was when I was able to confidently say, "I know how to make a website". Maintaining that website, which is a portfolio of my hobbies, is, well, one of my hobbies. While I do not expect people to visit it - <a href="https://www.google.com/search?ei=ZFUHW7-XL7q-0PEPhL2fwA8&q=https%3A%2F%2Falan-lam.github.io&oq=https%3A%2F%2Falan-lam.github.io&gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i160k1.11070.17302.0.18094.32.30.2.0.0.0.179.3093.18j12.30.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.24.2409...0j0i131k1j0i10k1j0i22i30k1j0i22i10i30k1.0.PXOY7iOQs18" target="_blank">or find it through a Google search much less</a> - I still treat it as if people are visiting it. So I am still learning little things here and there to improve it.</p>

          <p>This website is the second website I've created. This website is the result of roughly 5 months of learning and building. Being a student at the time, the total number of hours is actually less than 5 months. Whether that's impressive or not, I would say that the time it takes to learn isn't that long. Granted, having programming experience helps immensely, but you don't really need to know how to code to make a website.</p>
          <p>With that said, welcome to this website. Made by a beginner.</p>
